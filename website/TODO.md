DISCUSSION POST

- The 'community-maintained' phrase is deliberate, it offers a certain degree of separation from the main project.

- I'll be contacting the authors of Marp themes that could be found through the marp-theme topic on Github and I'll add their themes if they say yes. Tell them to include licenses in their work and link to these licenses.
