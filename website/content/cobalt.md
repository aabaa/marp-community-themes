This theme is based on the `cobalt` theme made by [Kent Pribbernow](https://github.com/elitistsnob/typora-cobalt-theme) for Typora, which was inspired by the Sublime Text theme made by [Wes Bos](https://github.com/wesbos/cobalt2). The [Nunito](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito) font-family is used as the main font.

# Custom classes and keywords

`<!-- _class: tinytext -->`

- Makes most text on the slide much smaller.
- Might be useful for references.

`![center](image.jpg)`

- By default, images are left-aligned.
- The `center` keywords centers the image.
