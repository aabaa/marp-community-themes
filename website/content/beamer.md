The `beamer` theme tries to mimic the look of LaTeX's Beamer class. As such, it is intended to be used with the [Computer Modern Unicode font family](https://ctan.org/pkg/cm-unicode?lang=en). It also provides support for a title page, but I am not a web-developer, so breakage should be expected.

# Custom classes and keywords

`<!-- _class: title -->`

- Changes the layout of the slide to a title page.
- Make sure to include the underscore "_" so that your whole presentation is not made up of title pages.

`<!-- _class: tinytext -->`

- Makes most text on the slide much smaller.
- Might be useful for references.

`![center](image.jpg)`

- By default, images are left-aligned.
- The `center` keywords centers the image.
