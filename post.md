As a follow-up to my query from March 29 ([#285](https://github.com/marp-team/marp/discussions/285)), I have decided to create a [gallery for community themes](https://github.com/rnd195/marp-community-themes) (hosted on [Vercel](https://marp-community-themes.vercel.app/)). There are currently only 3 simple themes made by me, but I will be trying to contact the authors of other Marp themes that can be found through the marp-theme topic on Github and hopefully add their projects as well.

The website is built using Hugo, which should make community submissions relatively simple. The submission procedure is outlined [in the repository](https://github.com/rnd195/marp-community-themes#submitting-themes). 

The goal is to host the submitted CSS themes inside this community repository. One example of why this centralization may be helpful is the avoidance of dead links—I use Marp in VSCode and I have found it quite convenient to just use URLs for accessing themes.

I would be very happy to hear your suggestions about the theme gallery—both practical and technical, as I am not a web developer.
